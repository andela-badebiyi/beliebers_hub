Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we would never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love,
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck,
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)
I'm gone

Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning (frowning)
But hey now (hey now), you know, girl (know girl),
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

As long as you lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love me (love me)

I'll be your soldier,
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress (don't stress), don't cry (don't cry), we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke

Yo, B-I-G
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous it,I'll fly you to it,
I'll beat you there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without 'U'
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do (do it)
Used to tell me, 'Sky's the limit', now the sky's our point of view (view)
Man now we stepping out like, 'Whoa' (Oh God)
Cameras point and shoot (shoot)
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true, true, true,
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

Don't do it to me [x2]
Oh, no, no, Oh, no, no
Don't do it to me [x3]
Oh, no, no, Oh, no, no

[Verse 1 - Justin Bieber:]
Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothing like that (eh, eh, eh)
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That's right I think she foreign
I think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

[Pre-Chorus:]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

[Chorus:]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

[Verse 2 - Justin Bieber:]
She said it's her first time (oh, ya, ya)
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn (oh, ya, ya), and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted (oh, ya, ya), but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive. I could still smell her perfume
It's not hard to notice that I'm open
Hypnotized by the way she moves

[Pre-Chorus:]
Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

[Chorus:]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

[Bridge:]
She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why (IEH)
I'm addicted, something like an addict (chance)
Got me twisted (the rapper), but still I gotta have it (IEH)

[Verse 3 - Chance the Rapper:]
Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or an ass, just her brains
Gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, here back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains and Icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock & roll
She say, 'I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing.'
Watch her twerk for a goodfella
She money down with The Money Team
(She's confident)
(ARGH!)

[Chorus:]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
And I'm down with it
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

[Bridge:]
She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it [x3]
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no [x4]
But still I gotta have it
