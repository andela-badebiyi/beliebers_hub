#Beliebers Hub
##Summary
This is a simple laravel project I created to practicalize my laravel training, its a simple fanbase website for serious Bieber fans. Bieber fans can post song lyrics to their favourite Bieber tracks to share with everyone, they can upload their 'Bieber Testimonials' and they can also go to the forum section and start a new discussion.

##Requirements

##Installation
1. From your root directory run `composer install`. This would install all the necessary dependencies
2. run cp .env.example .env
3. run php artisan key:generate
4. Create a database on your local machine with db_name = 'justin'
you will find a public folder where our index.php is. This is where the site is served from.
